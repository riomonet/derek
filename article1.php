	    <h1> Use storytelling as a structure to do research </h1>

	    <p>
		It’s sad to say, but many have come to see research as
		being expendable. If budgets or timelines are tight, research
		tends to be one of the first things to go. Instead of
		investing in research, some product managers rely on designers
		or—worse—their own opinion to make the “right” choices for
		users based on their experience or accepted best
		practices. That may get teams some of the way, but that
		approach can so easily miss out on solving users’ real
		problems. To remain user-centered, this is something we should
		avoid. User research elevates design. It keeps it on track,
		pointing to problems and opportunities. Being aware of the
		issues with your product and reacting to them can help you
		stay ahead of your competitors.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
		In the three-act structure, each act corresponds to a part
		of the process, and each part is critical to telling the whole
		story. Let’s look at the different acts and how they align
		with user research.
	    </p>

	    
	    <h2> Act one: setup </h2>

	    
	    <p>
		The setup is all about understanding the background, and
		that’s where foundational research comes in. Foundational
		research (also called generative, discovery, or initial
		research) helps you understand users and identify their
		problems. You’re learning about what exists today, the
		challenges users have, and how the challenges affect them—just
		like in the movies. To do foundational research, you can
		conduct contextual inquiries or diary studies (or both!),
		which can help you start to identify problems as well as
		opportunities. It doesn’t need to be a huge investment in time
		or money.
	    </p>

	    
	    <p>
		Erika Hall writes about minimum viable ethnography, which
		can be as simple as spending 15 minutes with a user and asking
		them one thing: “‘Walk me through your day yesterday.’ That’s
		it. Present that one request. Shut up and listen to them for
		15 minutes. Do your damndest to keep yourself and your
		interests out of it. Bam, you’re doing ethnography.” According
		to Hall, “[This] will probably prove quite illuminating. In
		the highly unlikely case that you didn’t learn anything new or
		useful, carry on with enhanced confidence in your direction.”
	    </p>

	    
	    <p> This makes total sense to me. And I love that this makes
		user research so accessible. You don’t need to prepare a
		lot of documentation; you can just recruit participants
		and do it!  This can yield a wealth of information about
		your users, and it’ll help you better understand them and
		what’s going on in their lives. That’s really what act one
		is all about: understanding where users are coming from.
	    </p>

	    
	    <p>
		Jared Spool talks about the importance of foundational
		research and how it should form the bulk of your research. If
		you can draw from any additional user data that you can get
		your hands on, such as surveys or analytics, that can
		supplement what you’ve heard in the foundational studies or
		even point to areas that need further investigation. Together,
		all this data paints a clearer picture of the state of things
		and all its shortcomings. And that’s the beginning of a
		compelling story. It’s the point in the plot where you realize
		that the main characters—or the users in this case—are facing
		challenges that they need to overcome. Like in the movies,
		this is where you start to build empathy for the characters
		and root for them to succeed. And hopefully stakeholders are
		now doing the same. Their sympathy may be with their business,
		which could be losing money because users can’t complete
		certain tasks. Or maybe they do empathize with users’
		struggles. Either way, act one is your initial hook to get the
		stakeholders interested and invested.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p> Once stakeholders begin to understand the value of
		foundational research, that can open doors to more
		opportunities that involve users in the decision-making
		process. And that can guide product teams toward being more
		user-centered. This benefits everyone—users, the product, and
		stakeholders. It’s like winning an Oscar in movie terms—it
		often leads to your product being well received and
		successful. And this can be an incentive for stakeholders to
		repeat this process with other products. Storytelling is the
		key to this process, and knowing how to tell a good story is
		the only way to get stakeholders to really care about doing
		more research.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
		This brings us to act two, where you iteratively evaluate a
		design or concept to see whether it addresses the issues.
	    </p>

	    
	    <h2>	Act two: conflict</h2>

	    
	    <p>
		Act two is all about digging deeper into the problems that you
		identified in act one. This usually involves directional
		research, such as usability tests, where you assess a
		potential solution (such as a design) to see whether it
		addresses the issues that you found. The issues could include
		unmet needs or problems with a flow or process that’s tripping
		users up. Like act two in a movie, more issues will crop up
		along the way. It’s here that you learn more about the
		characters as they grow and develop through this act.
	    </p>

	    <p>
		Usability tests should typically include around five
		participants according to Jakob Nielsen, who found that that
		number of users can usually identify most of the problems: “As
		you add more and more users, you learn less and less because
		you will keep seeing the same things again and again… After
		the fifth user, you are wasting your time by observing the
		same findings repeatedly but not learning much new.”
	    </p>

	    <p>
		There are parallels with storytelling here too; if you try to
		tell a story with too many characters, the plot may get
		lost. Having fewer participants means that each user’s
		struggles will be more memorable and easier to relay to other
		stakeholders when talking about the research. This can help
		convey the issues that need to be addressed while also
		highlighting the value of doing the research in the first
		place.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
		Researchers have run usability tests in person for decades,
		but you can also conduct usability tests remotely using tools
		like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or other teleconferencing
		software. This approach has become increasingly popular since
		the beginning of the pandemic, and it works well. You can
		think of in-person usability tests like going to a play and
		remote sessions as more like watching a movie. There are
		advantages and disadvantages to each. In-person usability
		research is a much richer experience. Stakeholders can
		experience the sessions with other stakeholders. You also get
		real-time reactions—including surprise, agreement,
		disagreement, and discussions about what they’re seeing. Much
		like going to a play, where audiences get to take in the
		stage, the costumes, the lighting, and the actors’
		interactions, in-person research lets you see users up close,
		including their body language, how they interact with the
		moderator, and how the scene is set up.
